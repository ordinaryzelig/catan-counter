= catan counter

this is a rails app that "keeps score" for you while playing settlers of catan.  i personally like playing catan on a real board with real players.  but we find ourselves losing a lot of time figuring out (among other things) how many more activated knights we need (or don't need).  we tried keeping track of it on paper.  but with the back and forth of barbarians attacking, cities being built/destroyed, knights activating/deactivating, it wasn't very effective.  i found this to be a good excuse to build a rails app.

the original intent was to keep track for cities and knights, but expansions are completely optional.

== expansions supported

cities and knights
fishermen of catan
